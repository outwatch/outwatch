# OutWatch
The Functional and Reactive Web-Frontend Library for ScalaJS

[![Typelevel incubator](https://img.shields.io/badge/typelevel-incubator-F51C2B.svg)](http://typelevel.org) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OutWatch/outwatch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OutWatch/outwatch) [![Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/assets/badges/scalajs-1.0.0.svg)](http://scala-js.org) [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/OutWatch/Lobby)

The syntax is almost exactly as in [ScalaTags](http://www.lihaoyi.com/scalatags/). The UI can be made reactive and allows for easy integration of third-party reactive-programming libraries (for example [Monix](https://monix.io/), [scala.rx](https://github.com/lihaoyi/scala.rx) or [airstream](https://github.com/raquo/airstream)). We integrate tightly with [cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats) and [cats-effect](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect) to build safe web applications. In OutWatch, you can describe your whole web application without doing any side effect - you only run your application when rendering it.
