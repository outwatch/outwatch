# OutWatch - Functional and reactive UIs with Rx, VirtualDom and Scala [![Typelevel incubator](https://img.shields.io/badge/typelevel-incubator-F51C2B.svg)](http://typelevel.org) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OutWatch/outwatch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OutWatch/outwatch) [![Scala.js](http://scala-js.org/assets/badges/scalajs-0.6.15.svg)](http://scala-js.org) [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/OutWatch/Lobby)


## Getting started

First you will need to install Java and SBT if you haven't already.
Create a new SBT project and add the ScalaJS plugin to your `plugins.sbt`.
Then add the following line to your `build.sbt`.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.github.outwatch" %%% "outwatch" % "0.10.2"
```

Please test the latest release candidate and report any issues and questions you encounter:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.github.outwatch" %%% "outwatch" % "1.0.0-RC2"
```

If you are curious and want to try the state of the current `master` branch, add the following instead:

```scala
resolvers += "jitpack" at "https://jitpack.io"
libraryDependencies += "com.github.outwatch" % "outwatch" % "master-SNAPSHOT"
```

And you're done, you can now start building your own OutWatch app!
Please check out the [documentation](https://outwatch.github.io/) on how to proceed.


## Three main goals of OutWatch

1. Updating DOM efficiently without sacrificing abstraction => Virtual DOM
2. Handling subscriptions automatically
3. Removing or restricting the need for Higher Order Observables
