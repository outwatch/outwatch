# OutWatch - Functional and reactive Web-Frontend Library with Reactive Programming, VirtualDom and Scala [![Typelevel incubator](https://img.shields.io/badge/typelevel-incubator-F51C2B.svg)](http://typelevel.org) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OutWatch/outwatch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OutWatch/outwatch) [![Scala.js](http://scala-js.org/assets/badges/scalajs-0.6.15.svg)](http://scala-js.org) [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/OutWatch/Lobby)


```scala
import outwatch.dom._
import outwatch.dom.dsl._
import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global

OutWatch.renderInto("#app", h1("Hello World")).unsafeRunSync()
```

Syntax is almost exactly as in [ScalaTags](http://www.lihaoyi.com/scalatags/) combined with Observables from [Monix](https://monix.io/).

You can find more examples and features in the changelog: https://github.com/OutWatch/outwatch/blob/changelog/CHANGELOG.md

## Getting started

### g8 template
For a quick start, install `java`, `sbt`, `nodejs` and `yarn` and use the following g8 template:
```bash
sbt new outwatch/seed.g8
```

In your newly created project folder, run:
```bash
sbt dev
```

and point your browser to http://localhost:8080.

Changes to the code will trigger a recompile and automatically refresh the page in the browser.

### Manual usage
Install `java`, `sbt` and  `nodejs`, if you haven't already.
Create a new SBT project and add the ScalaJS and Scala-js-bundler plugin to your `plugins.sbt`:
```scala
addSbtPlugin("org.scala-js" % "sbt-scalajs" % "0.6.23")
addSbtPlugin("ch.epfl.scala" % "sbt-scalajs-bundler" % "0.13.0")
```
Then add the outwatch dependency to your `build.sbt`.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.github.outwatch" %%% "outwatch" % "1.0.0-RC2"
```

If you are curious and want to try the state of the current `master` branch, add the following instead:

```scala
resolvers += "jitpack" at "https://jitpack.io"
libraryDependencies += "com.github.outwatch" % "outwatch" % "master-SNAPSHOT"
```

To configure hot reloading with webpack devserver, check out [build.sbt](https://github.com/OutWatch/seed.g8/blob/master/src/main/g8/build.sbt) and [webpack.config.dev.js](https://github.com/OutWatch/seed.g8/blob/master/src/main/g8/webpack.config.dev.js) from the [g8 template](https://github.com/OutWatch/seed.g8).

### Documentation
There is a PR with a corresponding changelog which also serves as documentation with examples: https://github.com/OutWatch/outwatch/blob/changelog/CHANGELOG.md

There is also the slightly outdated but conceptually still correct [documentation](https://outwatch.github.io/) -  [contributions welcome](https://github.com/OutWatch/outwatch.github.io).

## Three main goals of OutWatch

1. Updating DOM efficiently without sacrificing abstraction => Virtual DOM
2. Handling subscriptions automatically
3. Removing or restricting the need for Higher Order Observables
